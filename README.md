# WIREFRAME

Very often patients would like to be more informed when selecting a doctor for a particular procedure. So they could find a doctor who is best suited to their current needs.â€¨

I wanted to develop a web application that allowed doctors to easily update their information so that patients can find out more about what they do best.
